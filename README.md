## Hi ! I'm Dimitri and welcome to my GitHub page
I'm a French student in college, learning software development and coding in general. Currently, you'll only find the projects I did for college on my page.

I'm mainly interested in object oriented programmation langages like Java or C#, or procedural langages like C. I always try to make an efficient code that I understand, that has documentation, and that my collegues will understant too.

Outside of studying, I like to sometime do modding on Terraria, a indie video game from 2011.

You can find me on these websites :
